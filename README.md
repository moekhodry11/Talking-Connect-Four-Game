# Talking-Connect-Four-Game

This repository contains the code, design files, and documentation for a smart Connect Four game developed as a graduation project in collaboration with the College of Disability Sciences. The project involved adding technology to the traditional Connect Four game using Arduino. The game features two IR sensors to detect the coin placement, two push buttons for level control, a 7-Segment display to show the current level, and a speaker for sound feedback. The game board and pieces were designed using Fusion 360, and the wooden components were fabricated using a laser cutting machine.

# Features:
- Smart Connect Four game with enhanced technology
- Arduino-based gameplay logic and controls
- Two IR sensors for coin detection
- Push buttons for level control
- 7-Segment display to show the current level
- Speaker for sound feedback based on the current level

# Components Used:
- Arduino Nano: Controls the gameplay and user interactions
- IR sensors: Detect coin placement on the game board
- Push buttons: Enable level control functionality
- 7-Segment display: Shows the current level
- Speaker: Provides sound feedback during gameplay

# Folder Structure:
- Arduino_Code: Contains the Arduino code for controlling the gameplay, IR sensor integration, push button handling, 7-Segment display control, and speaker - functionality
- Design_Files: Includes the Fusion 360 files for the game board and pieces
- Documentation: Contains project documentation, including circuit diagrams, assembly instructions, user manual, and code explanations
